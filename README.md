It all sparked from a simple idea.

I always wanted to make something and be known for making it—recognition.

So I started by thinking about the things I like:

- I love to code and I think I’m pretty good at it.
- I midjourney for fun now. I’m basically addicted.
- One Piece is my bible.
- Shohei Ohtani is my role model.

Hmm… I guess I’ll make a website that tells the story of Shohei Ohtani. With a bunch of One Piece easter eggs.

So…

1. I made a rough draft in Notion. (_do it. it helps_)
2. I started a SvelteKit repo with Sanity (_dope tech_)
3. I started generating Midjourney images with my own Notion template. (_omg so fun_)
4. I made art using the Web as the medium with the theme _unconventional but practical UI_. (_sry I’m an art major_)
5. I bought a domain. (_actually I bought it waaay back lol_)
6. I documented it. ([`this`](/README.md))

The end.
