		Ōshū, Iwate Prefecture. July 5, 1994. A small city in northern Japan where winter winds shape
		character and discipline is inherited.
	</p>
	<p>
		Young Shohei played baseball with his father, a factory worker. His mother, a former badminton
		player, taught him the value of dedication. Humble origins. Infinite ambition.
	</p>
	<p>
		Hanamaki Higashi High School, 2010-2012. Here he created his famous mandala chart—64 goals
		mapping the path to greatness. Every detail planned. Every sacrifice calculated.
	</p>
	<p>
		Spring Kōshien, 2012. His team fell short of glory, but the nation glimpsed his 100 mph
		fastball. Scouts circled. Destiny waited.
