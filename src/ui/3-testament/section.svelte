	<p>
		Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters, 2013. Drafted first overall. MLB teams beckoned immediately, but
		manager Hideki Kuriyama saw something rare: potential meeting patience.
	</p>
	<p>"Stay," Kuriyama said. "Master both crafts here first. Then conquer the world."</p>
	<p>
		Five years. 42 wins on the mound. 48 home runs at the plate. Pacific League MVP, 2016. The
		two-way dream wasn't fantasy—it was blueprint.
	</p>
	<p>
		Every strikeout proved the skeptics wrong. Every home run silenced the doubt. In NPB, Shohei
		Ohtani built the foundation for what modern baseball deemed impossible.
	</p>
	<p>December 9, 2017. His testament complete. The posting granted. America awaited.</p>
