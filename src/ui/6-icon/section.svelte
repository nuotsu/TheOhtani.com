	<p>
		Beyond the statistics and the highlights, Shohei Ohtani has become an icon—a symbol of what's
		possible when you refuse to accept limitations.
	</p>
	<p>
		He transcends baseball. A symbol of excellence without ego. Power without arrogance. Greatness
		with grace.
	</p>
	<p>
		Shohei Ohtani taught a generation that limits are negotiable. That impossible is just a word.
		That humility and dominance can coexist.
	</p>
	<p>
		His legacy isn't just records—it's permission. To dream bigger. To work harder. To be
		extraordinary while remaining yourself.
	</p>

	<p>And the story continues...</p>
